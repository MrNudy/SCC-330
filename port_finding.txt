How I got it to work(Windows)
plug in to USB port in BOOTSEL mode by holding BOOTSEL on the pi pico when plugging in.
open file explorer and find RPI-RP2 as a new drive (mine was E:/)
use that as upload_port in the .ini file

if you get the message that it is detected in BOOTSEL and picotool is not able to access it:
follow this link: https://zadig.akeo.ie/
Use zadig to set RP2Boot(interface1) driver to WinUSB
Mine worked after that
